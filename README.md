# CAPTCHA Solver
Solving CAPTCHA using Convolutional Neural Network

This project is tries to solve python-generated CAPTCHAs using Convolutional Neural Network. By running the program, the specific amount of CAPTCHAs are generated into a folder which then are been used as the training set for the network.

## How to run
To run the code following python packages are required:
- captcha 
- opencv-python
- opencv-python-headless
- opencv-contrib-python-headless
- keras

Also, th following linux packages are required
- libsm6
- libxext6

To run the code open (Captcha_Solver_Alphanumerical.ipynb)[https://github.com/zaraanry/CAPTCHA-Solver/blob/master/Captcha_Solver_Alphanumerical.ipynb] or (Captcha_Solver_numerical.ipynb)[https://github.com/zaraanry/CAPTCHA-Solver/blob/master/Captcha_Solver_numerical.ipynb] in jupyter notebook and run them.
